This project predicts future stock prices using real-time NSE market data without requiring any downloaded dataset. 
The system combines both Machine Learning (K-Nearest Neighbors) and Deep Learning (LSTM Neural Networks) to forecast 
short-term stock price movement. Additionally, the app performs news sentiment analysis using Moneycontrol RSS feeds to 
understand market mood and influence on stock direction.

The dashboard is built with Streamlit and features a modern neon-style user interface with interactive candlestick charts. 
Users can control forecasting parameters like historical data range, prediction horizon, KNN neighbors, LSTM lookback window, 
and training epochs. The application also displays model accuracy using MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to compare performance.
